# The-World-of-Art App API
# About Project
The World of Art is an app that helps users find any piece of art they can think of. The app gives the user a biographies of the artist as well. I am a huge art lover and this app has is indeed a big help. Being able to find work by your favorite artist with just a quick search or scroll is amazing!
#Presentation
Art is such a beautiful thing. This app will showcase workings of all the greats. Picasso, Van Gogh, Da Vinci, Manet and countless others. The Metropilitan of Art is a museum where the works of artist are in person. With this app those who can not get to the actual museum can still view the art. In this presentation I will showcase my ability to turn the works of the museum into a virtual catalog.
